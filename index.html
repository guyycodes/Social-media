    <h1>6-WEEK CONTENT CYCLE</h1>
    <p>Business Owner → Engineer → Builder. TikTok + YouTube First. Repeat. Iterate. Grow.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="intro">
    <p>You're not someone who "learned to code." You ran a business for 7 years, went back for CS at 35, and built a modular widget platform that serves restaurants, contractors, delivery businesses, auto services, home services, and more. You have instincts from both sides. That's the story.</p>
    <div class="positioning">
      "I'm not learning how to build a company. I already did that. I chose to become an engineer so I could build the next one myself. And I did."
    </div>
    <p>Everything happens during and right after your 10-mile morning run. iPhone chest strap → record thoughts mid-run → edit footage → post to TikTok + YouTube. That's the system.</p>

        <ul class="topic-list">
          <li>What I solved in my head before 6 AM today<span>A bug, a business decision, a Widgetfied feature — talk to the chest cam at mile 8 when it clicks. #runtok #morningrun</span></li>
          <li>The difference between mile 2 and mile 9<span>Mile 2 you're still waking up. Mile 9 you've already made 3 decisions for the day. Record both moments — show the shift.</span></li>
          <li>Why I run 10 miles minimum — not 3, not 5<span>The cognitive payoff doesn't kick in at 5K. Talk to the camera when you feel the switch happen. #distancerunning #10milerun</span></li>
          <li>What a double day looks like (10 in the AM, 10 in the PM)<span>Strap up for both runs. The second run is different energy — darker, quieter. Show both.</span></li>
          <li>Running in the dark at 4:45 AM — the chest cam POV<span>Nobody's out. Headlamp or streetlights. The visual of running alone before dawn is TikTok gold. #4amclub #earlymorningrun</span></li>
          <li>The worst run this week and why I still went<span>Not every run is good. The point is the streak, not the split. #runstreak #runnerslife</span></li>

          <li>A feature I shipped this week and why it matters<span>Tie it to a real customer problem. You've lived the problem — explain the fix mid-run. #buildinpublic #shipfast</span></li>
          <li>Why Widgetfied starts free and Growth is $29/month<span>Free tier to get in the door. The business owner in you set the pricing. The engineer in you built enterprise quality.</span></li>
          <li>The Genius Router — delivery route optimization without the jargon<span>VRPTW sounds intimidating. Explain it as: "your delivery routes, but smart." Perfect for a mid-run explainer clip.</span></li>
          <li>The Cart & Menu widget — and why restaurants need it<span>AI dietary recommendations, online ordering, spreadsheet POS. One widget replaces 3 tools. #restauranttech</span></li>

          <li>What being homeless at 20 taught me about showing up<span>16 months. No safety net. Running kept you sane. That discipline never left. #runtok #nevergiveup</span></li>
          <li>What 7 years of running a business taught me that a CS degree didn't<span>Customers, cash flow, failure tolerance. The business came first — the engineering came after.</span></li>
          <li>Starting over at 35 — what that decision actually felt like<span>Not inspirational. Terrifying. But you'd already survived worse. Talk about it at mile 8.</span></li>
          <li>How running brought clarity after rock bottom<span>The running ramped up. The clarity came back. You went from surviving to choosing. #runningcommunity</span></li>
          <li>My dad died and I finished my degree anyway<span>Not "in spite of." Just: it happened, and I kept going. That's it.</span></li>

          <li>What discipline actually looks like vs. what social media thinks it looks like<span>It's not cold plunges and journals. It's running 10 miles when you slept 5 hours. #reallife #nodaysoff</span></li>
          <li>The one thing that would fall apart if I stopped running<span>Everything. The code quality. The patience at PF. The focus at night. All of it. #runtok #runningmotivation</span></li>

Here's the real answer: I ran my own business for 7 years. I know exactly what these small business owners go through — the scheduling chaos, the wasted drive time, the "I'll figure it out later" that never gets figured out. I'm not learning about my customers at PF. I already was one.

I'm surrounded every day by restaurant owners, mobile detailers, HVAC techs, contractors, plumbers, personal trainers, landscapers, cleaning services, electricians. Their problems are the ones I already lived. Widgetfied already solves all of it — modular widgets they plug in and use.

Here's what I said: I ran a business for 7 years and lived the exact problems my customers have — no online ordering, wasted delivery routes, manual scheduling, chasing payments. So I went back to school at 35, got my CS degree, and built the solution myself.

Widgetfied is a modular widget system for service businesses. 6 widgets: Cart & Menu (online ordering + AI dietary assistant + spreadsheet POS), Genius Router (delivery route optimization — VRPTW), Booking (with Google Calendar sync), Payments (Stripe + Venmo), AI Estimates (photo-based), and a Customer Portal. Embed any of them on any website with 2 lines of code. No platform lock-in. Free to start, $29/month for Growth.

I didn't hire someone to build this. I became the engineer.

Give me:
1. TikTok edit: Hook text overlay + 3 caption options. Make it sound like I casually explained what I build while running 10 miles at 5 AM. Not a pitch — just a guy talking to his chest cam about what he ships at night.
2. YouTube: Title + description for a "what I'm building" run vlog. 5-8 min. Full run footage with the Widgetfied explanation woven in.

I didn't just feel bad for them. I recognized every one of those problems. I ran a business for 7 years. I was that guy. That's why I went back for CS at 35. Not to "learn to code." To build the solution I needed when I was them.

Widgetfied is a modular widget system. 6 widgets, each solving a specific problem for service businesses. They embed on any website with 2 lines of code. No platform lock-in.

I'm splicing the screen recording with the chest strap run footage. Give me:
1. TikTok (60-90s): Hook text overlay + 3 caption options. "I had this problem for 7 years so I became an engineer and built the fix" energy. Short, punchy.

              <div class="ai-prompt-text">I recorded my chest strap run today and at mile 7 I talked through my tech decisions for Widgetfied. Here's what I said:

Widgetfied is a modular widget platform — 6 widgets (ordering, routing, booking, payments, AI estimates, customer portal) that embed on any website with 2 lines of code. It runs on [YOUR STACK — Next.js, Clerk, Stripe Connect, Google Sheets integration, MobX, etc.].

I chose embeddable widgets over a full platform because business owners don't want to migrate. I chose Google Sheets integration because that's what small business owners actually use. I chose Stripe Connect so money goes directly to them, not through me.

Most engineers choose tools based on what they know. I chose tools based on what my customers need — because I was the customer for 7 years.

I'm editing for TikTok (60-90s) and YouTube (5-8 min run vlog). Give me:

1. TikTok (60-90s): Hook + 3 caption options. Leveling up energy, not starting over.
2. YouTube: Title + description for a "what's next" run vlog
3. Hashtags: #runtok #runningtiktok #morningrun #runnersoftiktok #4amclub #buildinpublic #saastok #techtok #foundertok #grindtok #runningcommunity #10milerun #newcycle #levelup #contentcreator</div>

  <!-- PLATFORM EXPANSION STRATEGY -->
  <div class="expansion-card">
    <h2>Cycle 2+ — Platform Expansion Strategy</h2>
    <div class="subtitle">TikTok + YouTube are home base from Day 1. Chest strap run content is native to both platforms. After 6 weeks of dialing in the format, expand based on data.</div>
    <div class="platform-grid">

      <div class="platform-card">
        <h3>LinkedIn</h3>
        <div class="roi-tag roi-high">HIGH ROI — Add in Cycle 2</div>
        <ul>
          <li>2700 existing connections — built-in audience waiting</li>
          <li>Repurpose chest strap clips as LinkedIn native video</li>
          <li>Text posts from run thoughts (AI-assisted from transcripts)</li>
          <li>"Business owner → engineer at 35" resonates with LI audience</li>
          <li>Professional credibility + founder story = engagement</li>
          <li>Post 3x/week: Mon, Wed, Fri (text + video mix)</li>
          <li>Drive LI connections to your TikTok + YouTube</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="platform-card">
        <h3>Instagram (Reels)</h3>
        <div class="roi-tag roi-medium">MEDIUM ROI — Add in Cycle 2-3</div>
        <ul>
          <li>Reels = same chest strap content as TikTok (cross-post)</li>
          <li>Carousel posts work well for "day in the life" recaps</li>
          <li>Stories for behind-the-scenes: run stats, code screenshots, Strava</li>
          <li>Wait until you have 10-15 TikToks to repost as a content library</li>
          <li>Your Strava screenshots + code screenshots = feed content</li>
          <li>Create account in Cycle 1, start posting Cycle 2-3</li>
          <li>Cross-post TikToks directly — IG Reels algorithm rewards it</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="platform-card">
        <h3>X (Twitter)</h3>
        <div class="roi-tag roi-low">LOWER ROI — Optional Cycle 3+</div>
        <ul>
          <li>Good for tech/founder audience but requires daily engagement</li>
          <li>Thread format works for your running × coding parallels</li>
          <li>Less video-native than TikTok/YouTube</li>
          <li>Time-intensive: need to reply, quote tweet, stay active</li>
          <li>Only add if TikTok + YouTube + LinkedIn are running smoothly</li>
          <li>Best for: connecting with indie hacker / SaaS community</li>
          <li>Can repurpose run thoughts as tweets/threads</li>
        </ul>

  <!-- CYCLE INFO -->
  <div class="cycle-info">
    <h3>The System</h3>
    <p>Complete all 6 weeks, then return to Week 1 with fresh content. Each cycle deepens your story, grows your audience, and expands to new platforms. iPhone chest strap → run → spit thoughts → edit → post to TikTok + YouTube. You ran a business for 7 years. You got a CS degree at 35. You run 10 miles a day. You built and shipped a modular widget platform for service businesses — ordering, routing, booking, payments, AI estimates, customer portals. Free to start. Now let people see it. The AI prompts work every time — feed them your raw run footage transcript and direct the output with your depth. The chest strap POV is your signature. The run is the content.</p>
